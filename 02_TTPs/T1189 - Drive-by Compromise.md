# Drive-by Compromise

## Description

Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist (i.e., Drive-by Target ), including:

Browser push notifications may also be abused by adversaries and leveraged for malicious code injection via User Execution . By clicking "allow" on browser push notifications, users may be granting a website permission to run JavaScript code on their browser. [1] [2] [3]

Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or a particular region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring. [4]

Typical drive-by compromise process:

Unlike Exploit Public-Facing Application , the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.

## Mitigations

| ID | Mitigation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| M1048 | Application Isolation and Sandboxing | Browser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but sandbox escapes may still exist. [71] [72] Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of client-side exploitation. The risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in implementation may still exist for these types of systems. [72] |
| M1050 | Exploit Protection | Security applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior. [73] Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring. [74] Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility. |
| M1021 | Restrict Web-Based Content | Adblockers can help prevent malicious code served through ads from executing in the first place. Script blocking extensions can also help to prevent the execution of JavaScript. Consider disabling browser push notifications from certain applications and browsers. [75] [76] [77] |
| M1051 | Update Software | Ensuring that all browsers and plugins are kept updated can help prevent the exploit phase of this technique. Use modern browsers with security features turned on. [78] |
| M1017 | User Training | Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction. |

## Detection Strategy

| ID | Name | Analytic ID | Analytic Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| DET0176 | Drive-by Compromise — Behavior-based, Multi-platform Detection Strategy (T1189) | AN0498 | Correlated evidence of anomalous browser/network behavior (suspicious external resource fetches and script injection patterns) followed by atypical child processes, ephemeral execution contexts, memory modification or process injection, and unexpected file drops. Defender sees network requests to previously unseen/suspicious domains or resources + browser process spawning unusual children or loading unsigned modules + file writes or registry changes shortly after those requests. |
| AN0499 | Correlated evidence of browser or webview fetches to uncommon domains or mutated JS resources (proxy/NGFW logs + Zeek/HTTP logs) followed by unexpected interpreters or script engines executing (python, ruby, sh) spawned from browser processes or user sessions, rapid on-disk staging in /tmp, and outbound connections that deviate from baseline. Defender sees: uncommon resource fetch → short-lived child process executions from user browser context → file writes in temp directories → anomalous outbound C2-like connections. |  |  |
| AN0500 | Correlated evidence where Safari/Chrome/WebKit-based processes issue network requests for uncommon or obfuscated JS resources followed by spawning of script interpreters, launchd or ad-hoc binaries, unusual child processes, or dynamic library loads into browser processes. Defender sees: proxy/HTTP logs with suspicious resource content + unifiedlogs/ASL showing browser/plugin crashes or extension loads + process events indicating child process creation and file writes to /var/folders or /tmp shortly after the fetch. |  |  |
| AN0501 | Post-compromise identity & session anomalies that follow a drive-by compromise: token reuse from new/unfamiliar IPs, anomalous sign-in patterns for previously inactive users, unexpected consent/grant events, or provisioning changes. Defender sees an endpoint/browser compromise (network + endpoint signals) followed by unusual IdP events: new refresh token issuance, consent/consent-grant events, odd MFA bypass patterns, or unusual OAuth client registrations. |  |  |
